# Contribution Guidelines

Before sending a Pull Request, ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines and policies.


### Adding a resource

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[resource](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are appreciated. You're welcome to discuss discrimination and categorization criteria in Issues/PRs.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive, pointing out the particularities or major features of the resource.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- It's `Game Boy`, not `gameboy`, `game boy` or `GameBoy`, however, you should honor the title or name of the resource while linking it, even if it's using a wrong lettering \[[1](https://github.com/avivace/awesome-gbdev/issues/34)\].

### Unavailable resources

You're welcome to remove any broken link in the repository, but first try to find a reliable mirror and replace it:

- Check on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) and Google Cache;
- We may already mirrored it in [*The Game Boy Archive*](https://github.com/gb-archive/core) project;
- Try the GitHub search.

If you are sure the resource is completely gone, add the resource link, description and any other useful details in [this](https://github.com/gb-archive/missing) file.

You can then proceed to remove the broken link.

If you have some old and unavailable resource (not necessarly listed in the missing list) archived in your hard disk that maybe in the interest (even historical!) of the Game Boy development community, please get in touch or send a PR in the ["missing"](https://github.com/gb-archive/missing) repository.

#### Thank you!
