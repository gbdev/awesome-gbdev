Existing emulators are very accurate but are not documented very clearly, so they are not that good references for emulator developers. This project is meant to document as clearly as possible _why_ certain behaviour is emulated in a certain way. This also means writing a lot of test ROMs to figure out corner cases and precise behaviour on real hardware.
