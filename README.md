#### Disambiguation

Although this documentation is focused on the original (1989) Game Boy (DMG), the *Game Boy Color* (GBC) and *Super Game Boy* (SGB) are very similar systems, with few important distinctions, such as:

- Different hardware specifications
- Specific hardware and software features
- Specific registers
- Specific bugs and exploitable behaviours

If you aim to develop your software for SGB or GBC, or you want to know how it runs on the others system, you may want to take advantage and adapt to these differences, check for specific references to GBC/CGB and SGB in the documentation section.
