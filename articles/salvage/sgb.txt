 A SGB command transfer is 128 bits + a zero bit. The first five
bits of the first byte is the command byte. The last 3 bits of
the first byte represent the number of 128 bit packages to be
sent. Unused bits in a SGB command transfer should be set to 0.
 Most of the commands listed below only transfer one package.
The command bytes below are preceded by the # character to remind
you that they have to be shifted left three times before used.


Palettes
--------

 There are several different types of palettes in the SGB.
One type is the System color palette. It is a virtual palette
rather than a hardware palette. The hardware color palette
is shown at the bottom of this document and contains what
are called the SGB color palettes and also holds the SGB Border
palette.

 As far as SGB onscreen colors are concerned there are
only really two palette types: SGB color palettes and
the SGB border palette.

 The SGB border palette is setup using command $14.
There are 64 colors in this palette.

 The SGB color palettes may be set directly using
commands $00-$03. There are a total of four of
these palettes and they determine which colors are
used in the main game action window. The color for
bit 00 will be the same for all SGB color palettes.
The color most recently stored in bit 00 will be used.

 The SGB color palettes may be set indirectly using
the System color palettes using commands $0a-$0b.
There are a total of 512 of these palettes.


SGB Border
----------

 The SGB border is often shown as colorful graphics that
surround the main game action window. The truth is that the
SGB border actually covers the whole viewing screen and
has the highest viewing priority. The reason it appears be
just a "border" around most games is due to the fact that
usually a 160x144 pixel wide box is drawn in the center of
the SGB "border" using color 0. Since this color is
transparent, the main game action window under it is visible.

 Creating a program to convert a 16-color GIF to a SGB
border is relatively easy and has been done for DOS.
(i.e.gif2sopt.exe) What is not so easy is converting a
64-color GIF to a SGB border because each tile only has
access to 16-colors. The 16-color palette that the tile
has access to is determined by the tile attribute byte.
The tile attribute byte is described in the 'Picture
Transfer' command ($14) below.

Main Action Window
------------------

 The SGB cartridge that plugs into the SNES contains
a GB CPU. The SNES is able to video capture the video
output of this GB CPU and display it on the screen as
the main game action window. Since the SNES is only
doing a raw video capture it only knows about 4 levels
of grey coming from the GB CPU. In order to add more
than 4 colors to the main game action window, the SGB
software allows you to assign 1 of the 4 SGB color
palettes for each 8x8 tile position in this window.
"Block"($4), "Line"($5), "Divide"($6), "1Chr"($7),
and "Set Attr from ATF"($15) all are different means
for setting the palettes for each 8x8 tile location.
On reset, each 8x8 tile position defaults to SGB
color palette 0.

 Commands $4-$7 are various methods for block-setting
the 8x8 tile color palettes. The "Set Attr from ATF"
($15) allows you to select 1 of 45 "ATtribute Files".
Each "ATtribute File" contains 90 bytes (20x18x2 bits).
By selecting an "ATtribute File", you can exactly
select 1 of 4 SGB color palettes for each 8x8 tile
location due to the fact that these files contain
2 bits of information for each 8x8 tile location.


Commands
--------

Set SGB color Palettes
 0 & 1 ($00,data) - Download color palettes 0 & 1
 2 & 3 ($01,data) - Download color palettes 2 & 3
 0 & 3 ($02,data) - Download color palettes 0 & 3
 1 & 2 ($03,data) - Download color palettes 1 & 2
--------------------------------------------------

Here is example data for setting SGB color palettes 0 & 1:

        DW      $7fff    ;white      ;bit 00 color

;Pallete 0
        DW      $7c00    ;blue       ;bit 01 color
        DW      $03e0    ;green      ;bit 10 color
        DW      $0000    ;black      ;bit 11 color

;Palette 1
        DW      $03ff    ;yellow     ;bit 01 color
        DW      $001f    ;red        ;bit 10 color
        DW      $0000    ;black      ;bit 11 color


 Please note that all four SGB color palettes share the
same bit 00 color. The color most recently stored in
bit 00 will be used.

 Information for calculating the DW color value is given later
in this text.

 When using the following four Palette Direct Set commands,
the GameBoy image will be altered (colors changed) even if
you used the GameBoy Window Mask command to freeze the screen.
Therefore use arguments Black or White with the Window Mask
command before using the following four commands. If you want
to freeze the screen, send palette data with the Attribute
File ATF0-ATF44. In the event you are changing the screen by
sending attribute data and color data at the same time, use
Set SGB Palette Indirect command.

CharSet Transfer ($13) (%00000xyy)
  (x=Char Type:0=BG,1=OBJ  y=CharSet Range:0=00-7f,1=80-ff)
-----------------------------------------------------------

 The tiles that are downloaded to the SNES for the border
are regular GB tiles that have been modified for extra colors.
Every tile consists of 32 bytes. The format is:

 16 bytes - Standard 4 color GB character set
 16 bytes - Extended color information

 The same way GB uses two bytes to convey 8 pixels
and the 4 colors for each pixel, the extended color
info uses the same technique for determining extended
colors. This tells the SNES which color palette to
use to display each pixel. This allows a total of 16
colors per tile. Since SGB borders support up to 64 colors,
access to the other colors are achieved by changing the
Major palette number in the picture transfer tile map.


Picture Transfer ($14) - Download border to SNES.
------------------------------------------------

 The border (or tile map) that is downloaded is 32x28 tiles
or 256x224 pixels. The regular GB screen fits right in the
middle like this:

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXX....................XXXXXX
XXXXXX....................XXXXXX
XXXXXX....................XXXXXX
XXXXXX....................XXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

 The tile map consists of a tile number byte & a tile attribute
byte at each position on the map. A total of 32 lines are
downloaded even though the last 4 lines are not visible. This
would equal 64 bytes per line and a total of 2048 bytes per map.
Next, a 64 x 2 byte color palette for the map is downloaded.
The first palette entry color is transparent. Use this color
to display regular GB screen underneath.

 The tile number comes before the tile attribute of each position.
There can be up to 1024 tiles from which to select. The SGB only
supports 256 so bits 0 & 1 of the tile attribute must be set to 0.
Here are the tile attributes I understand so far:

Bit 7 - Vertical flip tile
Bit 6 - Horizontal flip tile
Bit 5 - Does nothing (Set to 0.)
Bit 4 - Select Major Palette MSB (Usually set to 1.)
Bit 3 - Select Major Palette  -
Bit 2 - Select Major Palette LSB
Bit 1 - Tile # MSB (Most significant bit) (Set to 0.)
Bit 0 - Tile # NSB (Next most significant bit) (Set to 0.)

 This is often called the SGB border but in fact it covers
the whole SNES screen. The Major Palette select has 8
different settings. Only the last 4 - 7 are normally used
thought to access all 64 colors transfered with cmd (#14).
(NOTE: If using 'gif2sopt.exe' to generate a border, the
 range of the palette selections is 1-8 so select palette
 5 since that program only allows up to 16 colors.)


Set Attribute from ATF ($15)
----------------------------

 The data for 45 Attribute files is transfered with
 this command. Each ATtribute File is 90 bytes so
 90x45 or 4050 bytes of data are transfered. Each
 attribute file uses 5 bytes per 8x8 horizontal
 line (20 x 4 char/byte x 2 bits/palette) to
 describe the color palettes of a line.
 Example ATF data:

   DB $ff,$00,$00,$00,$02    ; Line #1
   DB $ff,$00,$00,$00,$02    ; Line #2
   DB $ff,$00,$00,$00,$02    ; Line #3
   .....
   DB $ff,$00,$00,$00,$02    ; Line #18

 The above ATtribute File would set the SGB color
 palette selection to 3 for the first 4 columns
 of the main game action window. The last column
 would have SGB color palette 2 selected. All the
 other columns would have palette 0 selected.


Set Data from ATF ($16) (data)
------------------------------

 Transfer specified ATtribute File to GameBoy window.

data:
  %/xyyyyyy    x - 0 = No Change, 1 = Cancel mask after xfer ATF
               yyyyyy = ATtribute File number ($00-$2c)


GameBoy Window Mask ($17) (data)
--------------------------------
data:
  $00 = Off
  $01 = Transfers VRAM to SNES until cancelled.
  $02 = Mask so that all color codes in SGB
        color palette are black.
  $03 = Mask so that all color codes in SBG
        color palette are white.


Super NES OBJ Mode ($18)
------------------------

SNES Color Palette Info
-----------------------

 The Nintendo Super Famicom is capable of displaying 256 colors from a
palette of 32,768. These 256 colors are split into 16 palettes of 16 colors
each. Only 8 of these palettes are accessible by the SGB.

Color data is made up of 3 components (Red,Green,Blue) each of 5 bits (The
Amiga uses exactly the same system, but only using 4 bits per component).

                      00000 00000 00000
                      \   / \   / \   /
                       \ /   \ /   \ /
                        B     G     R

Examples:
~~~~~~~~~
         00000 10111 11100
         11111 00000 00000 = $7C00 (Bright Blue)
         00000 11111 00000 = $03E0 (Bright Green)
         00000 00000 11111 = $001F (Bright Red)
         00000 00000 00000 = $0000 (Black)
         11111 11111 11111 = $7FFF (White)


SGB Palette Selection
---------------------

 There is actually only one color palette in the SNES
but it is divided up into several sections for different
SGB functions. These sections are referred to as Major (M)
sections 0-7. Some SGB functions even divided some of these
sections into sections. These sections are referred to as
minor (m) sections. The large blocks below represent Major
sections or palettes and smaller ones below them represent
minor palettes. There are 4 colors per minor palette and
16 colors per Major palette:

+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|   0   |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7   |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|0|1|2|3|                        ^                             ^
